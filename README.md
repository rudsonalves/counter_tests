# Basic Counter Project

This is a basic counter project refactored with the structure:

- models
  - counter.dart - a basic counter with a privade attribute `_value` and getter/setter, methods to increment/decrement/reset value;
  - limited_counter.dart - a counter limited to the range [-5, 5];
  - person.dart - a class to store the `_name` and `_surname` attributes, with getters and setters, and a special getter to generate a full name.
- pages
  - home_page.dart - show all instances of classes in models folder;
  - settings_page - a simple page for reset values in models instances.
- themes
  - colors
    - color_schemes.g.dart - a color scheme generated by [https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom), with small changes;
  - theme.dart - a simple theme file to define lightTheme and darkTheme.
- app.dart - a file with MaterialApp declarations
- main.dart - a simple main function to run the project.


# ValueNotifier Commit

In this commit, I added a ValueNotifier to implement application state-management and redraw screen widgets on demand.

The transport of instances of the Counter, LimitedCounter, and Person classes continues to be done by the `Navigator.of(context).pushNamed` arguments (line 28+ in the home_page.dart module).

The implementation was made by main changes:

**Models changes:**
1. in models files, the class attibutes were declared by `ValueNotifier` like diff below:
```
- int _value = 0
+ ValueNotifier<int> $value = ValueNotifier(0);
```
2. now the setters and getters take and place values in `$value.value`, or `$name.value`/`$surname.value` for the Person class;

**Modules home_page.dart and settings_page.dart changes:**

3. now the two classes, `HomePage` and `SettingsPage`, have been transformed into `StatelessWidget`. It is not necessary for the classes to be `StateFullWidget`s, since the `ValueListenableBuilder` and `AnimatedBuilder` methods are responsible for redrawing the parts of the screen that are necessary;
4. `onPressed` can receive methods directly from instances of classes `HomePage` and `SettingsPage`;
5. `Text()` widgets now are called by a `ValueListenableBuilder`, replacing lines like this:
```
Text('${_counter1.value}', style: headlineMedium),
```
by 
```
ValueListenableBuilder(
  valueListenable: _counter1.$value,
  builder: (context, value, _) {
    return Text('$value', style: headlineMedium);
  },
),
```
and 
```
Text('Full Name: ${_person.fullName}'),
```
by a AnimatedBuilder like
```
AnimatedBuilder(
  animation: Listenable.merge([_person.$name, _person.$surname]),
  builder: (context, _) {
    return Text('Full Name: "${_person.fullName}"');
  },
),
```
since the method `fullName` needs to listen for changes in `_person.$name` and `_person.$surname`.
